# Default Categories

Modders can specify a category for their mod to appear in when first installed. To do so, go to your mod's .XComMod file and add the following line:

```
category=Category Name
```

To prevent different mod creators from having their mods default to different sets of categories, here is a list of standardized categories to use:

* Bugfixes
* Enemies
* Gameplay
* Highlanders
* Maps
* Overhauls
* Quality of Life
* Soldier Classes
* Soldier Customization
* UI
* Utilities
* Voicepacks
* Weapons
* (Overhaul Name) Addons - overhaul names should not be abbreviated

If you feel a category needs to be added to this list, please suggest it [here](https://trello.com/c/qofx1Sg2/23-category-suggestions).
